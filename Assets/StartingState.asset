  storyText: "I wake up and notice I'm not in my room.  I wonder what's happened while
    I was sleeping.  The room looks like it's going to fall apart at any moment.\r
    \ I can see there is a single exit through a battered wooden door.\r\n\r\nWhat
    should I do?\r\n\n1. Immediately leave the room and try to see what's going on.\r\n2.
    Explore the room, looking for clues."
