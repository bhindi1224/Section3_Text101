I wake up and notice I'm not in my room.  I wonder what's happened while I was sleeping.
The room looks like it's going to fall apart at any moment.
I can see there is a single exit through a battered wooden door.

What should I do?
1. Immediately leave the room and try to see what's going on.
2. Explore the room, looking for clues.
